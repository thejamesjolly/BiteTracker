	Bug found

May 26th, 2021 
	Code was not training on variety of window size based on input argument.  
	Instead was printing argument but using a hardcoded value of just 5 sec window size

May 30th, 2021
	Realized in PersevStepA.sh, the only data for training was fold 1 since the input file was hardcoded.
